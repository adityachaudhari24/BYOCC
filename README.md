# BYOCC - Build Your Own Commerce Components

## What is BYOCC ?
BYOCC (Build Your Own Commerce Components) is an open-source initiative offering templates, patterns, and reference implementations for building modular e-commerce components on public cloud platforms which can easily fit in your composable architecture, promoting MACH principles along with leveraging public cloud managed services for agility and reliability.


# The Evolution of E-Commerce: From Monoliths to Composable Architecture

##  The Rise and Fall of Monolithic Commerce Platforms
E-commerce has evolved significantly, moving from monolithic platforms like Oracle ATG and IBM WebSphere Commerce to more agile, modular solutions. While these legacy platforms were foundational, their rigid architectures and high costs led to their decline. Modern platforms like Shopify, Adobe Commerce, and Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Hybris introduced flexibility and faster deployment, but even they face challenges in meeting ever-evolving digital commerce demands.


##  The PaaS Commerce Era: Benefits and Limitations
Movement of monolith platforms to their cloud offerings as a PaaS(Platform as a Service) like SAP Commerce Cloud, salesforce cloud, Magento
was adoption these companies had to do as to align with the cloud native adoption of overall industry.
However, these PaaS solutions often come with limitations, such as vendor lock-in, high costs, and lack of flexibility. As businesses sought more control and customization, the need for a new approach became evident.

**PROS of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Commerce**
- Comprehensive feature sets out of the box
- Established implementation methodologies and partner ecosystems
- Predictable upgrade paths and vendor support
- Integrated capabilities across commerce, content, and marketing functions

**CONS of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Commerce**
- High total cost of ownership including licensing, implementation, and maintenance
- Limited flexibility to adapt to unique business requirements
- Lengthy implementation timelines (often 6-12+ months)
- Innovation constrained by vendor roadmaps and release cycles
- "One-size-fits-all" approach leading to unnecessary bloat.


##  The MACH Revolution: Response to Changing Requirements - Composable Commerce Architecture
The MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless) architecture emerged as a response to the limitations of monolithic and PaaS solutions. By breaking down commerce functionalities into modular components, businesses can select best-of-breed solutions tailored to their specific needs. This approach not only enhances flexibility but also accelerates time-to-market and reduces costs.

**MACH architecture addresses many of the limitations of monolithic platforms by enabling:**
- Independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components
- Greater flexibility in choosing best-of-breed solutions for specific needs
- Improved performance through targeted resource allocation
- Enhanced developer experience with modern technology stacks
- Faster time-to-market for new features and capabilities.

# FAQs
## Why BYOCC(Build-Your-Own-Commerce-Components) When PaaS Platforms Already trying to aligning to MACH principles?

While PaaS platforms offer MACH principles, they come with limitations like vendor lock-in, high costs, and limited flexibility.

Most important benefit BYOCC offers is the ability to innovate, try and adopt change quickly as possible without huge investment.
Apart from these below are some other benefit if your POC and then MVP is successful with your BYOCC components.
1. Avoid vendor lock-in by selecting best-of-breed components.
2. Achieve greater customization to meet unique business needs.
3. Reduce costs by leveraging public cloud's pay-as-you-go model.
4. Innovate faster with access to advanced cloud services (AI, ML, etc.).
5. Scale globally with the agility of public cloud platforms.

BYOCC provides the freedom and agility that PaaS platforms often lack, enabling truly composable commerce architectures.


## Is BYOCC replacement to PaaS platforms?
NO, absolutely not, it's an attempt to provide tested templates to build your own commerce components which can easily fit in your composable PaaS architecture frameworks.

## How to Get Started with BYOCC?
1. **Explore the Templates**: Browse through the available templates and patterns to find components that suit your needs/scenarios. (TODO - add link to templates)
2. **Contribute** : As its just the beginning of BYOCC, we are looking for contributors to help us build more templates and patterns. If you have experience in building commerce components or have ideas for new templates, please suggest ideas by creating an issue or pull request.
