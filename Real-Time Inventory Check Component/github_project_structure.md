## User Stories

### Customer-Facing Features
- **US-1**: As a customer, I want to see accurate stock levels on product pages so I can make informed purchase decisions
- **US-2**: As a customer, I want my selected items to be reserved during checkout so they don't sell out while I'm completing my purchase
- **US-3**: As a customer, I want to see different stock status indicators (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock) so I can quickly understand product availability

### Administrator Features
- **US-4**: As an administrator, I want to update inventory levels for products so I can keep stock information accurate
- **US-5**: As an administrator, I want to receive notifications when stock drops below thresholds so I can reorder products
- **US-6**: As an administrator, I want to view current inventory levels across products so I can monitor stock status
- **US-7**: As an administrator, I want to set threshold levels for products so I can customize when low stock alerts are triggered

### E-commerce Platform Integration
- **US-8**: As a platform developer, I want clear API documentation so I can integrate the inventory component with our e-commerce platform
- **US-9**: As a platform developer, I want to call the reservation API during checkout so customer selections are temporarily secured
- **US-10**: As a platform developer, I want to call the release API when items are removed from cart so inventory is accurately reflected
- **US-11**: As a platform developer, I want to call the fulfill API when orders are confirmed so inventory is permanently decremented
