# Real-Time Inventory Check Component README

## Overview

The Real-Time Inventory Check Component is a key module designed for integration into e-commerce platforms. It eliminates "phantom inventory" issues by providing accurate, up-to-the-minute stock information to customers and administrators through a serverless AWS architecture.

This component enables:
- Real-time stock visibility on product pages
- Temporary stock allocation during checkout
- Accurate inventory management upon order completion
- Proactive low-stock notifications for administrators
- Secure inventory management tools and APIs

## Documentation Structure

This module's documentation is organized into the following sections:

- **[Architecture and Overview](architecture_and_overview.md)**: Provides a detailed system architecture, user personas, workflows, and technical flows.
- **[Requirements (FR & NFR)](requirements_FR_and_NFR.md)**: Outlines functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and technical specifications.

## About BYOCC

This component is part of BYOCC (Build Your Own Commerce Components), an open-source initiative that provides templates, patterns, and reference implementations for building composable e-commerce components on public cloud platforms. BYOCC embraces MACH principles while advocating for the use of public managed services to enhance agility and reliability.

BYOCC is not a replacement for PaaS platforms but rather a complementary approach that allows organizations to build custom components that fit within their composable architecture framework and can be used alongside PaaS solutions.
